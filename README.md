# Badminton Team Sorter

## Introduction

This repository contains code for the badminton team sorter from my personal Final year university
project.

#### Description

This is an android studios project that is written in Java. It uses SQLite to store all the data internally
on the phone. The app is designed to help clubs sort out games for their sessions so that it is more
fair on the people that are playing so that there are not those that play too much and those that
play too few. This app is also able to balance the teams so that there isn't too much of a strength
difference between the teams. The strengths of each of the players are determined in an Elo like system
that can be found quite commonly in chess and computer games where there is a ranking involved. 

## How to run the application
